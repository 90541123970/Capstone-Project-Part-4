 **description**:
This project is a responsive Pokémon gallery web app created as part of a web development capstone project. It showcases skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring an interactive "Load More" button that dynamically loads additional Pokémon images and descriptions. The app’s design adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a user-friendly experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
**challanges**:
Load More Button Functionality: Implementing the "Load More" button to dynamically load more Pokémon cards was initially tricky, particularly in managing the number of displayed images and hiding the button once all images were loaded.
Integrating Descriptions in Cards: Including both an image and description in each card required careful styling to maintain visual balance without overcrowding the cards.
