 <br>**description**:
<br>This project is a responsive Pokémon gallery web app created as part of a web development capstone project. It showcases skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring an <br>interactive "Load More" button that dynamically loads additional Pokémon images and descriptions. The app’s design adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a user-friendly <br>experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
<br>**challanges**:
<br>Load More Button Functionality: Implementing the "Load More" button to dynamically load more Pokémon cards was initially tricky, particularly in managing the number of <br>displayed images and hiding the button once all images were loaded.
<br>Integrating Descriptions in Cards: Including both an image and description in each card required careful styling to maintain visual balance without overcrowding the cards.
